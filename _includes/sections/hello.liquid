	<div class="more-about">
		<hr>
		<p>I’m a generalist designer with a flair for discovering real user needs and solving complex problems. </p>
		<hr>
		<p>I enjoy the technical and operational part of the design practice – making design systems and various other tools that help us work more effectively, getting together with cross-functional teams and figuring out how we can collaborate better and constantly help evolve our design methods.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>I'm also a designer who codes and loves tech. In my free time, I often find myself building various side-projects.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>When I’m not knee-deep in Miro boards; Dovetail tags; Google docs; Git repos or zoomed-in at a 1500% in Figma, I like to climb on top of big rocks, read & write about DesingOps and perpetually create helpful things with technology.</p>
