	<div class="more-about">
		<hr>
		<p>I’m a generalist designer with a flair for discovering user needs and solving complex problems. </p>
		<hr>
		<p>I love the technical and operational part of the design practice – making design systems and various other tools that help us work more effectively, getting together with cross-functional teams and figuring out how we can collaborate better and constantly help evolve our design methods.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>When I’m not entrentched in Miro boards; Dovetail tags; or Google Sheets, I like to climb on top of big rocks, read & write about DesingOps and perpetually create new things.</p>
<!-- 		<p>I’ve spent most of my career helping build digital products.</p>
		<p>When I started out doing this, most designers were required to code – which was awesome and is still something I enjoy doing. I think building one's ideas forces one to elevate one's craft.</p>
		<p>Today, after having gone through a few different design roles, I spend most of my time trying to fuse people’s needs with the business' wants by doing different types of discovery, synthesis, socialization and execution of design work.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Interests include climbing on top of big rocks, reading &amp; writing about interaction design and perpetually creating new&nbsp;things.</p> -->
