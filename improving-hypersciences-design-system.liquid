	<p>At Hyperscience, I had the opportunity to discover efficient ways to improve our design system by surfacing quick-wins and establishing a common vocabulary within the different teams.</p>
	<h2>Case study Available on request</h2>
	<p>I'm currently assessing appropriate ways to publicly expose some of the more sensitive information inside this case study, whilst keeping the content meaningful and informative.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, should you be interested in this story, feel free to <a href="/#contact" class="inline-link">contact me</a></p>
