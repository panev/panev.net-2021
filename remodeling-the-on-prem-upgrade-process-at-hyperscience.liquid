	<p>During my time at Hyperscience, we reimagined the upgrade process &ndash; reducing time-to-value for enterprise customers and increasing overall adoption of our product.</p>
	<h2>Case study Available on request</h2>
	<p>I'm currently assessing appropriate ways to publicly expose some of the more sensitive information inside this case study, whilst keeping the content meaningful and informative.</p>
